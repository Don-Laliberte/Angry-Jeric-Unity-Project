# Angry-Jeric-Unity-Project
Small game jam/crash course 2D Unity game that I originally made in two days for fun to practice Unity.

This Github repo stores the project folder. All you have to do is import it into UnityHub. The game is based off of Angry Birds and was made for my own enjoyment and has a nice little practice project for unity.
